## Relationship Manager - Hackathon 

Caraclock is one of the devices in the Memory Museum that supports the creation of collective memory among family members. During the hackathon, you will be able to contribute to this project by working on a specific section of the development of the relationship manager. The Relationship Manager is a web app that allows users to indicate their relationships through a web app. 

**__Web App Requirements:__**

- Users should be able to input a list of names and their family relationships.
- After adding names and relationships, the user interface should display the names as dots as shown in the screenshot below.
- The users should be able to drag and drop nodes to reflect relationship closeness.

- Based on the distance between the main person (central node) and others, a list of probabilities should be generated. Since these are independent events, probabilities should range from 0 to 1.
- The final output should be an ordered list of names, relationships, and probabilities, sorted in descending order (highest probabilities first).
The interaction should produce a CSV file.
