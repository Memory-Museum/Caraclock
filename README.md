## Caraclock 

Caraclock is one the devices in the Memory Museum. This device originally designed by Uriu et al. facilitates the reminiscense and creation of collective memory by allowing users to interact with personal and family pictures. Caraclock has three modes: a regular clock, a digital photo browser and a synchonized version. These modes aim to give agency to users to interact with their memories on their own and share them with others if they synchronize with other Caraclock devices.
